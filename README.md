# LDR_light


An LDR is a component that has a (variable) resistance that changes with the light intensity that falls upon it. This allows them to be used in light sensing circuits.  


Connections

LDR sesnor to Arduino
Sensor D0 pin = Arduino digital pin 7
Sensor GND pin = Arduino GND pin
Sensor VCC pin = Arduino 5v pin
LED to Arduino
LED VCC pin = Arduino digital pin 13
LED GND pin = Arduino GND pin
